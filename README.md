## Overview

You are provided with a basic React implementation that uses the [Ball Don’t Lie](https://docs.balldontlie.io/#nba-api) API to fetch information about NBA players and teams. Currently it:

- Fetches the first `50` players.
- Displays the players in the received order.
- Applies basic styling and team colors.
- Defines the types as `any`.

## Task

Your goal is to further enhance the functionality by:

- [DONE] Evaluating and discussing if any improvements can be made to the current implementation.
- [DONE] Fetching the first `150` players (instead of `50`).
- [DONE] Grouping the players by their respective teams.
- [DONE] Sorting players within each team in ascending order by jersey number.
- [DONE] Rendering each team in a clearly separated and reusable component.
- [DONE] Styling the application with an appropriate design and semantic markup.

## Requirements and Expectations

- You're free to use Google search and any AI assistant of your choice.
- You’re free to use any libraries you’re comfortable with for data handling, state management or styling.
- Your primary focus should be on demonstrating your approach to best practices regarding:
  - Code structure and organization
  - API data fetching and manipulation
  - Creating flexible and maintainable React components

We will discuss your decisions and trade-offs as you code, so feel free to explain your thought process and reasoning.
